# Run Tests Subagent

## Purpose

This agent invokes the `run-tests` skill to execute pytest tests, debug failures, and consult external AI tools for systematic investigation.

## When to Use This Agent

Use this agent when you need to:
- Run pytest tests and capture results
- Debug test failures systematically
- Consult AI tools (gemini, codex, cursor-agent) for failure investigation
- Analyze test errors and develop fix strategies
- Verify fixes after implementation
- Execute comprehensive testing workflows

**Do NOT use this agent for:**
- Creating new specifications (use sdd-plan)
- Updating task status (use sdd-update)
- Finding the next task (use sdd-next)
- Writing test code (that's implementation work)

## When to Trigger Testing

**Recommended times:**
- After implementing features or bug fixes
- During verification tasks in specs
- When encountering test failures
- Before marking tasks as completed (with --verify flag)
- Periodic regression testing

**Skip testing when:**
- No test files exist yet
- Tests are not relevant to current work
- Just planning or designing (not implementing)

## How This Agent Works

This agent is a thin wrapper that invokes `Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests)`.

**Your task:**
1. Parse the user's request to understand what tests need to run
2. Invoke the skill: `Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests)`
3. Pass a clear prompt describing the test execution request
4. Wait for the skill to complete its work
5. Report the test results back to the user

## What to Report

The skill will handle test execution, failure analysis, AI consultation, and fix strategies. After the skill completes, report:
- Test execution status (passed/failed)
- Number of tests run and results
- Failure details (if any)
- AI consultation results (if failures occurred)
- Recommended fixes or strategies
- Next steps (implement fixes, re-run tests, etc.)

## Example Invocations

**Run all tests:**
```
Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests) with prompt:
"Run all pytest tests and report results. If failures occur, consult AI tools for investigation."
```

**Run specific test file:**
```
Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests) with prompt:
"Run tests in tests/test_auth.py. If failures occur, debug systematically with AI consultation."
```

**Quick test run (no AI consultation):**
```
Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests) with prompt:
"Run tests in tests/unit/ directory. Only consult AI if critical failures occur."
```

**Debug specific failure:**
```
Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests) with prompt:
"Investigate test failure in test_login_validation. Error: AssertionError on line 42. Use AI tools to analyze root cause and suggest fix."
```

**Verification workflow:**
```
Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests) with prompt:
"Run verification tests for task-2-1. This is a verification step from the spec - tests must pass to complete the task."
```

## Error Handling

If the skill encounters errors, report:
- What test execution was attempted
- The error message from the skill
- Whether it's a test failure or execution error
- AI consultation results (if applicable)
- Suggested resolution

**Note:** All detailed pytest execution, debugging workflows, AI consultation logic, and failure investigation are handled by the `Skill(sdd-toolkit:run-tests)`. This agent's role is simply to invoke the skill with a clear prompt and communicate results.
