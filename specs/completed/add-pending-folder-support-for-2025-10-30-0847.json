Modified search logic to loop through both pending/ and active/ directories\n2. Added 'folder_status' field to spec_info dictionaries to track which folder each spec comes from\n3. Added visual indicator in format_output: pending specs show \u23f8\ufe0f emoji and [PENDING] label\n4. Updated error messages to mention both directories\n\n**Verification:**\n- Source code verified correct (all checks passed when importing directly)\n- 'folder_status' field confirmed present when running function with forced reimport\n- Logic tested and working when bypassing package installation\n\n## Current Blocker: Package Installation Issue\n\n**Problem:** Changes not appearing in installed package despite multiple reinstall attempts\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe 'sdd' command is installed globally in /home/tyler/anaconda3/bin/ and uses the installed package from site-packages, NOT the editable source. Multiple reinstall attempts using 'pip install -e .' did not update the installed version.\n\n**What We Tried:**\n1. pip install -e . --force-reinstall --no-deps\n2. Clearing Python bytecode cache (*.pyc files)\n3. Removing build/ directory and reinstalling\n4. Direct Python imports with forced module reload\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Source file has changes: grep shows 'folder_status' appears 5 times in source\n- Installed file missing changes: /home/tyler/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/ version has 0 occurrences\n- Direct import works: Running function directly with sys.path manipulation shows folder_status in output\n- Installed command fails: 'sdd skills-dev start-helper find-active-work' output missing folder_status field\n\n**Resolution Needed:**\nNeed to properly reinstall the package so the anaconda3/bin/sdd command uses the updated source code. This is a packaging/installation issue, not a code logic issue.\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- src/claude_skills/claude_skills/dev_tools/sdd_start_helper.py (lines 70-221)\n\n**Testing:**\n- Created test spec in pending/ folder\n- Verified pending directory exists and contains test spec\n- Direct function execution shows correct output with folder_status\n\n",
