# Spec-Driven Development Skill

A comprehensive skill for Claude that implements plan-first, verify-always development methodology.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development is a methodology that prioritizes creating detailed specifications before writing code. This approach:

- **Reduces drift**: Prevents AI from hallucinating APIs or misunderstanding requirements
- **Increases confidence**: Every change is planned, verified, and documented
- **Enables iteration**: Clear specifications make it easy to refine and adjust
- **Improves collaboration**: Specifications serve as contracts between team members
- **Catches issues early**: Problems surface during planning, not deployment

## How It Works

```
1. Understand Intent ‚Üí What are we trying to accomplish?
2. Explore Codebase ‚Üí What already exists? What patterns should we follow?
3. Create Specification ‚Üí Detailed plan with phases, files, and verification
4. Review & Refine ‚Üí Collaborate on the spec before implementing
5. Implement Phase-by-Phase ‚Üí Execute against the plan systematically
6. Verify Each Phase ‚Üí Test thoroughly at every step
7. Iterate if Needed ‚Üí Update spec and re-verify if issues arise
```

## When to Use This Skill

‚úÖ **Use Spec-Driven Development for:**
- New features or significant functionality additions
- Complex refactoring across multiple files
- API integrations or external service connections
- Architecture changes or system redesigns
- Large codebases where context drift is a risk
- Any task where precision and reliability are critical

‚ùå **Don't use for:**
- Simple one-file changes
- Trivial bug fixes
- Formatting or style changes only
- Quick prototypes or proof-of-concepts
- Exploratory code

## What's Included

### Core Documentation
- **SKILL.md** - Complete methodology guide for Claude
- **LICENSE.txt** - MIT license

### Reference Materials
- **examples.md** - Detailed real-world specification examples
  - REST API endpoint addition
  - Database schema migration
  - UI component refactoring
- **anti-patterns.md** - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- **quick-reference.md** - One-page cheat sheet

### Tooling
- **sdd-validate** - Standalone validator, report generator, and auto-fix utility for JSON specs
- **sdd-next / sdd-update** - Companion skills for execution planning and progress tracking
- **code-doc (optional parsers)** - Multi-language source parsing that relies on [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) bindings. Install the language packages you need (for example `pip install tree-sitter tree-sitter-javascript tree-sitter-typescript tree-sitter-go tree-sitter-html tree-sitter-css`). Modules fall back gracefully when bindings are absent.

### Assets
- **spec-template.md** - Ready-to-use specification template (use as a scratch pad before producing JSON)

## Quick Start

### Using with Claude

1. **Install the skill** in Claude (upload the skill folder)

2. **Trigger the skill** by asking Claude to help with development tasks:
   ```
   "Help me build a new user authentication system using spec-driven development"
   "I need to refactor our payment processing - create a specification first"
   "Let's add a new API endpoint for activity logs"
   ```

3. **Claude will:**
   - Explore your codebase to understand existing patterns
   - Create a detailed specification with phases
   - Present the spec for your review
   - Implement phase-by-phase with verification
   - Generate verification reports

### Working Locally

**Author the JSON spec manually (recommended):**
```bash
# Create initial skeleton (example)
cat <<'JSON' > specs/active/my-feature.json
{
  "spec_id": "my-feature-2025-10-22-001",
  "generated": "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z",
  "hierarchy": {}
}
JSON
```

**Use the markdown template as a scratch pad if helpful:**
```bash
cp assets/spec-template.md notes/my-feature.md
# Draft details here, then translate into JSON
```

**Validate specification quality with sdd-validate:**
```bash
# Validate JSON spec file (single source of truth)
sdd-validate validate specs/active/my-feature.json

# Generate stakeholder-friendly report
sdd-validate report specs/active/my-feature.json --output specs/reports/my-feature.md

# Preview fixes without modifying the file
sdd-validate fix specs/active/my-feature.json --preview
```

## Example Workflow

### 1. Request a Feature
```
You: "I need to add pagination to our user list API endpoint"
```

### 2. Claude Explores and Specifies
Claude will:
- Explore your codebase for existing patterns
- Identify files that need modification
- Create a phased specification
- Present it for review

### 3. Review the Specification
```
You: "Looks good, but can we add filtering by user status too?"
```

Claude updates the specification to include filtering.

### 4. Implementation
Claude implements phase-by-phase:
- Phase 1: Database query layer
- Phase 2: Service layer logic
- Phase 3: API controller and route
- Phase 4: Tests and documentation

After each phase, Claude verifies the changes work correctly.

### 5. Final Verification
Claude generates a comprehensive verification report showing:
- All planned changes completed
- No regressions introduced
- All tests passing
- Ready for deployment

## Key Principles

1. **Plan First, Code Second**: Always create specifications before implementation
2. **File-Level Specificity**: Know exactly which files will be modified and why
3. **Explicit Reasoning**: Every change must have clear justification
4. **Phase-by-Phase Execution**: Complete and verify each phase independently
5. **Comprehensive Verification**: Test everything at every step
6. **Document Deviations**: If implementation diverges from spec, explain why
7. **Stay On Spec**: Only implement what's in the specification
8. **Living Documents**: Update specifications as understanding evolves

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Confidence**: Know exactly what you're building and why
- **Speed**: Less time debugging, more time building
- **Clarity**: Clear roadmap from intent to implementation
- **Quality**: Built-in verification catches issues early

### For Teams
- **Alignment**: Everyone understands the plan
- **Reviewability**: Specifications are easier to review than code diffs
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Specifications serve as documentation
- **Reduced Rework**: Catch misunderstandings before implementation

### For AI-Assisted Development
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Specifications keep AI grounded
- **Better Context**: Clear plans help AI maintain focus
- **Verifiable Output**: Easy to check if AI implemented correctly
- **Iterative Improvement**: Specifications make refinement straightforward

## Inspired By

This skill implements Spec-Driven Development methodology, which brings engineering discipline to AI-assisted coding through:

- Planning before execution
- Structured, phase-based specifications
- Implementation verification
- Iterative refinement

## Best Practices

### Specification Quality
- Be specific enough that two people would implement identically
- Include examples and code snippets where helpful
- Base specifications on actual codebase exploration
- Document all assumptions and verify them

### Phase Design
- Keep phases to manageable scope (1-2 hours each)
- Ensure each phase is independently testable
- Define clear dependencies between phases
- Include verification steps for each phase

### Verification
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Include regression testing
- Document all verification results
- Don't skip verification steps

### Communication
- Share specifications before implementation
- Invite feedback and refinement
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Keep specifications updated

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with smaller features to learn the methodology
2. **Iterate on Specs**: First pass doesn't need to be perfect
3. **Verify Often**: Better to catch issues early than late
4. **Document Learnings**: Note what worked and what didn't
5. **Collaborate**: Specifications benefit from multiple perspectives
6. **Trust the Process**: The upfront planning pays dividends
