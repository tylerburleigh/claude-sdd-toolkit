# Validation Reports Directory

This directory stores validation reports generated by the SDD toolkit validation tools.

## Purpose

The `.reports/` directory is a hidden directory used to store:
- Spec validation reports generated by `sdd-validate`
- Automated validation results
- Historical validation data
- Quality metrics and analysis reports

## Why a Hidden Directory?

This directory is prefixed with a dot (`.`) to indicate it contains tool-generated content that is:
- Not part of the primary specification content
- Generated automatically during validation workflows
- Should not clutter the main specs directory structure
- Can be safely regenerated from the spec files

## Usage

### Generated by sdd-validate

When you run validation commands, reports are automatically saved here:

```bash
# Validation reports are generated by sdd-validate skill
sdd validate <spec-file>
```

### Report Types

Reports in this directory may include:
- **Validation summaries** - Overall spec file health and quality metrics
- **Error reports** - Detailed lists of validation errors and warnings
- **Historical reports** - Validation results over time
- **Dependency analysis** - Task dependency graphs and cycle detection

## Managing Reports

### Cleaning Old Reports

Reports can accumulate over time. To clean old reports:

```bash
# Remove reports older than 30 days
find specs/.reports -name "*.md" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Gitignore Consideration

Consider adding this directory to `.gitignore` if you don't want to track validation reports in version control:

```
# In .gitignore
specs/.reports/
```

Alternatively, keep reports in version control to track validation history across the team.

## Directory Structure

```
specs/.reports/
├── README.md                           # This file
├── <spec-id>-validation-report.md     # Individual spec validation reports
└── <spec-id>-<timestamp>-report.md    # Timestamped historical reports
```

## Related Tools

- **sdd-validate** - Validates spec files and generates reports
- **sdd-plan** - Creates specifications that are validated
- **sdd-next** - Uses validated specs for task preparation
- **sdd-update** - Updates spec state, triggering revalidation

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Validation** - Validate specs before starting new tasks
2. **Review Reports** - Check validation reports for quality issues
3. **Fix Issues Early** - Address validation warnings before they become errors
4. **Archive Old Reports** - Keep recent reports, archive or delete old ones
5. **Track Metrics** - Use reports to monitor spec quality over time

## Notes

- This directory is automatically created by the SDD toolkit
- It centralizes validation output in a dedicated location
- Reports are human-readable markdown format
- Automated tools can parse reports for CI/CD integration
