# Spec Review Outputs Directory

This directory stores spec review outputs generated by the SDD toolkit review tools.

## Purpose

The `.reviews/` directory is a hidden directory used to store:
- Spec reviews generated by `sdd-plan-review`
- Multi-model analysis results
- Architecture and security feedback
- Review history and consensus reports

## Why a Hidden Directory?

This directory is prefixed with a dot (`.`) to indicate it contains tool-generated content that is:
- Not part of the primary specification content
- Generated automatically during review workflows
- Should not clutter the main specs directory structure
- Can be safely regenerated from the spec files

## Usage

### Generated by sdd-plan-review

When you run review commands, outputs are automatically saved here:

```bash
# Reviews are generated by sdd-plan-review skill
Skill(sdd-toolkit:sdd-plan-review)
```

The review process consults multiple AI models to provide comprehensive feedback on specifications from different perspectives (architecture, security, feasibility, etc.).

### Review Types

Reviews in this directory may include:
- **Consensus reviews** - Multi-model analysis with synthesized recommendations
- **Model-specific feedback** - Individual perspectives from different AI models
- **Architecture reviews** - System design and structure analysis
- **Security reviews** - Security considerations and risk assessment
- **Feasibility reviews** - Implementation practicality and effort estimates

## Managing Reviews

### Cleaning Old Reviews

Reviews can accumulate over time. To clean old reviews:

```bash
# Remove reviews older than 30 days
find specs/.reviews -name "*.md" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Gitignore Consideration

Consider whether to track reviews in version control:

**Track reviews** (recommended for team collaboration):
- Preserves review history
- Enables team discussion
- Documents decision-making process

**Ignore reviews** (for personal projects):
```
# In .gitignore
specs/.reviews/
```

## Directory Structure

```
specs/.reviews/
├── README.md                              # This file
├── <spec-id>-review.md                   # Primary review output
├── <spec-id>-review-<model>.md           # Individual model reviews
└── <spec-id>-review-<timestamp>.md       # Historical review versions
```

## Related Tools

- **sdd-plan-review** - Reviews specifications using multiple AI models
- **sdd-plan** - Creates specifications that can be reviewed
- **sdd-validate** - Validates spec structure (complementary to reviews)
- **sdd-next** - Uses reviewed specs for task preparation

## Best Practices

1. **Review Early** - Get feedback before starting implementation
2. **Iterate on Specs** - Use review feedback to improve specifications
3. **Track Reviews** - Keep review outputs in version control for team visibility
4. **Multi-Perspective** - Leverage different model strengths (architecture, security, etc.)
5. **Document Decisions** - Use journal entries to record how reviews influenced the spec

## Review vs Validation

**Validation** (sdd-validate):
- Structural correctness
- Dependency analysis
- Compliance with spec format

**Reviews** (sdd-plan-review):
- Architectural soundness
- Security considerations
- Implementation feasibility
- Best practice recommendations

Both are complementary - validate for correctness, review for quality.

## Notes

- This directory is automatically created by the SDD toolkit
- It centralizes review outputs in a dedicated location
- Reviews are human-readable markdown format
- Multiple models provide diverse perspectives for better decision-making
